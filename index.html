    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>Myself Faisal Imam, I belong from Jharkhand state and I was born on 10th July, 2003. 
       I am passionate about web development and currently I am working on many different projects within this topic.
       I do some part time jobs to bear with my daily expenses. I think to be independent in any possible manner should be one's aim. 
       I am interested in teaching Physics and chemistry subjects to the students and also I want to help the studnets with their daily problems for which I do teach as an academic tutor on Filo.
       My aim is to become a pro web developer and grab a good career opportunity into this field.
